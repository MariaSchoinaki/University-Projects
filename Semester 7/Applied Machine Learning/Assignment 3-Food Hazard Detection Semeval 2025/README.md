# **Food Hazard Detection - SemEval 2025**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques** to detect food-related hazards from text sources. It is designed for **SemEval 2025**, a competition aimed at evaluating AI models for identifying food safety risks, contamination reports, and health hazards.

## **Key Topics Covered**
- **Text Preprocessing & Cleaning**
  - Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) for food-related hazards
- **Machine Learning & NLP Models**
  - Training classifiers to identify hazardous food mentions
  - Fine-tuning transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa)
- **Dataset Processing & Annotation**
  - Collecting and annotating food safety reports
  - Labeling hazardous vs. non-hazardous food mentions

## **Tasks & Concepts**
### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Load textual data and preprocess it for NLP modeling.
- Perform **text tokenization, stemming, and vectorization**.
- Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract food safety-related entities.

### **2. Machine Learning Classification**
- Train **logistic regression, SVM, and deep learning models**.
- Evaluate model accuracy using **precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- Compare traditional ML methods with transformer-based models.

### **3. Model Evaluation & Results Interpretation**
- Generate confusion matrices and classification reports.
- Optimize hyperparameters for best-performing models.
- Visualize **word distributions and embeddings**.
