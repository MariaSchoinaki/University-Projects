# Othello-Reversi-AI

Othello Reversi is a java based game build with graphics for our Artificial Intelligence course at AUEB. 
Othello is a two-player game, and in this project, the player plays against the AI, which is implemented with the Minimax algorithm using a-b pruning.
Our report for this project can be found in [greek](https://github.com/MariaSchoinaki/Othello-Reversi/blob/main/report_greek.pdf) and in [english](https://github.com/MariaSchoinaki/Othello-Reversi/blob/main/report_english.pdf).

## Features
- Responsive AI using MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
- Customizable depth for the MinMax algorithm, selected by the user. (1-5 can be visualized as difficalty level)
- Adaptable turn-user can choose if he wants to play first or second.
- Possible valid moves for the user are provided, to help him play easier.
