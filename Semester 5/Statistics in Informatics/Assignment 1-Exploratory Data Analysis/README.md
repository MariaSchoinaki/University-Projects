# **Assignment 1 - Statistical Data Analysis in Informatics**

## **Overview**
This assignment focuses on **exploratory data analysis and statistical summarization**, using both **manual calculations and statistical software**. The objective is to analyze different datasets, interpret statistical measures, and apply basic statistical visualization techniques.

## **Key Topics Covered**
- **Data Summarization Techniques**
  - Stemplots & Boxplots
  - Five-number summary vs. mean & standard deviation
- **Normal Distribution Approximation**
  - Density curves and normality tests
  - Normal quantile plots (QQ plots)
- **Data Collection & Visualization**
  - Finding and preparing real-world datasets
  - Identifying categorical and quantitative variables
  - Plotting variable distributions
- **Statistical Measures & Relationships**
  - Computing central tendency and dispersion
  - Scatterplots, correlation, and linear regression

## **Tasks & Concepts**
### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Construct **stemplots and boxplots** without software assistance.
- Compare **mean & standard deviation vs. five-number summary** for dataset representation.
- Assess **normality approximation** using density curves and QQ plots.

### **2. Real-World Data Collection & Analysis**
- Obtain a dataset with at least **one categorical and two quantitative variables**.
- Identify **variable types** and describe their distribution.
- Compute **summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, five-number summary)**.
- Visualize distributions using appropriate **graphs**.

### **3. Relationship Between Variables**
- Choose two variables and create a **scatterplot**.
- Compute **correlation coefficient** and analyze its meaning.
- Perform **linear regression analysis** and interpret results.

## **Tools Recommended**
- **R / Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for statistical analysis.
- **Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets** for data processing.
- **Draw.io** for visualizations.
