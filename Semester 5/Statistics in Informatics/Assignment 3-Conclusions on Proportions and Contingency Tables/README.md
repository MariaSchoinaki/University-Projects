# **Assignment 3 - Statistical Inference for Proportions and Categorical Data**

## **Overview**
This assignment focuses on **hypothesis testing for proportions, confidence intervals, and categorical data analysis using chi-square tests**. The goal is to evaluate sample proportions, test statistical significance, and analyze relationships between categorical variables.

## **Key Topics Covered**
- **Proportions & Confidence Intervals**
  - Estimating population proportions using sample data.
  - Constructing **95% confidence intervals** for binomial distributions.
- **Hypothesis Testing for Proportions**
  - Performing **z-tests for population proportions**.
  - Determining **statistical significance** using p-values.
- **Chi-Square Tests for Categorical Data**
  - Applying **χ² tests for independence**.
  - Constructing **contingency tables and analyzing relationships** between variables.

## **Tasks & Concepts**
### **1. Coin Toss Fairness Analysis**
- Conduct **50 coin flips** and count heads.
- Construct a **95% confidence interval** for the proportion of heads.
- Test if the coin is fair (**H₀: p = 0.5**) at a **5% significance level**.

### **2. Sample Size in Political Polls**
- Determine the required **sample size** to maintain a **3% margin of error** for **95% confidence level**.
- Compare required sample sizes between **Greece (10M population) and the USA (300M population)**.

### **3. Smoking & Gender Relationship Analysis**
- Use a provided **contingency table** of smoking habits across genders.
- Conduct a **z-test for proportion differences**.
- Perform a **chi-square test for independence** to determine if smoking habits differ by gender.
- Compare **p-values between z-test and χ² test**.

### **4. Color Proportion Analysis in Smarties & M&Ms**
- Analyze observed proportions of **Smarties colors (red, blue, yellow, etc.)**.
- Perform a **chi-square goodness-of-fit test** to determine if proportions differ from past distributions.
- Compare **Smarties vs. M&Ms** color distributions using **homogeneity testing**.

## **Tools Recommended**
- **R / Python (SciPy, StatsModels, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for statistical analysis.
- **Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets** for contingency tables.
- **Graphing tools** for categorical data visualization.
