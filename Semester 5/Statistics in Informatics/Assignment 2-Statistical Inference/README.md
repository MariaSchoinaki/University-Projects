# **Assignment 2 - Statistical Inference & Hypothesis Testing**

## **Overview**
This assignment focuses on **statistical inference techniques, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing**. The goal is to analyze dataset samples, compute confidence intervals, and evaluate statistical significance using hypothesis tests.

## **Key Topics Covered**
- **Confidence Intervals & Estimation**
  - Constructing **95% confidence intervals** for population means.
  - Comparing confidence intervals at different confidence levels.
- **Hypothesis Testing**
  - Identifying **null (H₀) and alternative (Hₐ) hypotheses**.
  - Performing **t-tests and p-value interpretations**.
  - Common errors in hypothesis testing.
- **Data Analysis & Statistical Reasoning**
  - Analyzing **real-world datasets** (e.g., processing times, fuel efficiency, insurance claims).
  - Evaluating **sample adequacy and statistical assumptions**.

## **Tasks & Concepts**
### **1. Database Query Processing Time Analysis**
- Compute **mean processing time** for database queries.
- Construct a **95% confidence interval** for the average query processing time.
- Assess whether the sample data meets the conditions for statistical inference.

### **2. Hypothesis Testing Errors**
- Identify and explain **incorrect applications of hypothesis testing**.
- Analyze **errors in statistical reasoning** related to p-values, sample sizes, and standard deviations.

### **3. Statistical Significance & p-value Interpretation**
- Compute **p-values** for given statistical tests.
- Determine statistical significance for **one-tailed and two-tailed tests**.

### **4. Real-World Confidence Interval Analysis**
- Calculate confidence intervals for **fuel efficiency in vehicles**.
- Determine whether sample data follows a **normal distribution**.
- Evaluate the accuracy of **confidence interval assumptions**.

### **5. Comparative Hypothesis Testing**
- Analyze **insurance claims estimation differences** between two expert groups.
- Determine if an insurance agency systematically overestimates claim values.
