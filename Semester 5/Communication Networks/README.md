# **Wireshark Network Analysis Assignment**

## **Overview**
This assignment involves the **use of Wireshark** for **network packet capture and analysis**. The goal is to explore the behavior of network protocols, including **ICMP, DNS, HTTP, and TCP**, by analyzing captured traffic and interpreting network communication patterns.

## **Key Topics Covered**
- **Packet Capture & Analysis** using **Wireshark**.
- **ICMP & Traceroute**: Examining network routes and time-to-live (TTL) values.
- **DNS & HTTP Traffic Inspection**: Understanding **domain name resolution and web traffic analysis**.
- **Transport Layer Analysis**: Investigating **TCP handshake, UDP communication, and secure transmissions**.

## **Tasks & Concepts**
### **1. ICMP & Traceroute Analysis**
- Capture ICMP packets using Wireshark.
- Perform **traceroute (tracert)** to examine the network path.
- Answer key questions on **packet duration, protocol identification, and source/destination addresses**.

### **2. DNS & HTTP Protocol Analysis**
- Capture DNS traffic to examine **query-response mechanisms**.
- Investigate **TCP handshakes** between the client and web server.
- Examine **HTTP GET requests and server responses**.

### **3. Network Traffic Statistics & Filtering**
- Use **Wireshark filters** to isolate specific protocol packets.
- Analyze **network endpoints, source/destination addresses, and port usage**.
- Inspect **TLS security parameters** for encrypted communication.

## **Tools Recommended**
- **Wireshark** (Download: [Wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org/))
- **Command Line (cmd/terminal)** for executing network commands.
- **Spreadsheet tools** for organizing captured packet data.
