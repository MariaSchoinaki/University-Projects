# **Assignment 1 - Self-Service Library System & Software Requirements**

## **Overview**
This assignment focuses on **system analysis and software requirements engineering** for two different real-world applications: a **self-service library station** and a **parking assistance system**. The objective is to identify **functional components, user interactions, and requirement classification**.

## **Key Topics Covered**
- **System Analysis:** Understanding **self-service and automated systems**.
- **Requirement Classification:** Differentiating between **descriptive and prescriptive** system requirements.
- **Logical Conditions & Assumptions:** Evaluating **system constraints and dependencies**.

## **Tasks & Concepts**
### **1. Self-Service Library System**
- Identify **functional and non-functional requirements**.
- Define **workflow steps** for book borrowing and returning.
- Consider **error handling** scenarios (e.g., overdue books, invalid library cards).

### **2. Parking Assistance System**
- Analyze how an **automated parking system** assists drivers in finding available spots.
- Define **software requirements and system constraints**.
- Explore **sensor-based parking monitoring** for availability tracking.
