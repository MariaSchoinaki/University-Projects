# **Assignment 6 - IT Project Management & Critical Path Analysis**

## **Overview**
This assignment focuses on **IT project planning and management**, utilizing techniques such as **critical path analysis (CPA), Gantt charts, and decision-making strategies** for software development. The objective is to optimize task scheduling and resource allocation.

## **Key Topics Covered**
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Organizing project tasks into hierarchical components.
- **Critical Path Analysis (CPA):** Identifying the longest sequence of dependent tasks.
- **Gantt Chart Visualization:** Mapping project schedules and dependencies.
- **Outsourcing vs. In-House Development:** Evaluating project cost-effectiveness.

## **Tasks & Concepts**
### **1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
- Define **phases of software development** (e.g., design, implementation, testing).
- Assign **task dependencies and estimated durations**.

### **2. Critical Path Analysis (CPA)**
- Compute the **critical path** for the project schedule.
- Identify **bottlenecks and possible optimizations**.
- Use **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)** for risk estimation.

### **3. Gantt Chart for Project Scheduling**
- Develop a **Gantt chart** to visualize task timelines.
- Adjust schedules to minimize **delays and resource conflicts**.

### **4. Decision-Making: Outsourcing vs. In-House Development**
- Compare the benefits and risks of **third-party development**.
- Analyze **costs, quality, and project feasibility**.

## **Tools Recommended**
- **Microsoft Project / GanttProject** for scheduling.
- **Draw.io / Lucidchart** for CPA diagrams.
- **Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets** for cost analysis.
