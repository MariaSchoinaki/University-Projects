# **Assignment - Advanced Database Concepts & Query Optimization**

## **Overview**
This assignment explores advanced database techniques, focusing on **query optimization, indexing strategies, and database storage efficiency**. The objective is to analyze query execution plans, design efficient index structures, and evaluate database performance.

## **Key Topics Covered**
- **Query Optimization & Execution Plans**
  - Understanding SQL execution steps
  - Optimizing query performance with indexing
- **Indexing Techniques & Hashing**
  - Using B+ Trees for efficient lookups
  - Hash-based indexing strategies
- **Database Storage & Cost Analysis**
  - Estimating storage costs based on block size and data distribution
  - Comparing sequential vs. indexed file access

## **Tasks & Concepts**
### **1. Query Optimization & Execution Analysis**
- Retrieve and interpret **query execution plans**.
- Compare execution performance for different **query structures**.
- Suggest optimizations using **indexes, partitioning, or caching**.

### **2. Indexing Techniques for Performance Improvement**
- Implement **B+ Tree indexing** for optimizing range queries.
- Compare **clustered vs. non-clustered indexes**.
- Analyze the efficiency of **hash-based indexing** in different query scenarios.

### **3. Storage Management & Performance Trade-offs**
- Calculate **disk space usage** for database storage.
- Evaluate the impact of **block size and access time** on query execution.
- Explore **compression techniques** to optimize storage efficiency.
