# **Assignment - Data Management Systems & Query Processing**

## **Overview**
This assignment explores fundamental concepts in **database storage, query optimization, and data indexing**. The primary focus is on analyzing data structures, storage mechanisms, and query performance in database management systems (DBMS).

## **Key Topics Covered**
- **Disk Storage & Performance**
  - Disk structure and block size analysis
  - Storage capacity calculations
  - Query execution time estimation
- **Indexing Techniques & Query Optimization**
  - Multi-level indexing
  - B+ Tree structure and insertion operations
  - Hash-based indexing and bucket allocation
- **Query Processing & Execution Plans**
  - SQL query performance evaluation
  - Data retrieval efficiency through hashing & indexing
  
## **Tasks & Concepts**
### **1. Disk Storage & Performance Analysis**
- Compute **sector size, cylinder allocation, and disk read performance**.
- Estimate time required to **read entire relations and specific record sets**.

### **2. Multi-Level Indexing & B+ Trees**
- Construct **multi-level sparse primary indexes**.
- Analyze **B+ Tree insertions** and balance adjustments.
- Evaluate **index efficiency for range queries**.

### **3. Hash-Based Indexing & Query Execution**
- Implement **linear hashing techniques** with bucket expansion rules.
- Analyze **query performance** for hash-based lookups.
- Compare **hashing and B+ trees for different query workloads**.

## **Tools Recommended**
- **DBMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite)** for query testing.
- **Python / R (Pandas, NumPy)** for storage and performance simulations.
- **Draw.io** for index and storage structure diagrams.
