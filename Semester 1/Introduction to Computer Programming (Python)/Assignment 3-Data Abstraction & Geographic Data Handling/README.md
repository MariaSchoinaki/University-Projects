# **Python Programming - Assignment 3**

## **Overview**
This assignment consists of **Python programming exercises** focusing on **abstract data types, recursion, nested lists, distance calculations, and functional programming**. The exercises involve implementing location-based computations, recursive list manipulations, and different functional paradigms to verify conditions over sequences.

---

## **Topics Covered**
### **1. Abstract Data Types (ADT) - Locations**
- Implementing a **data abstraction** for locations.
- Defining constructor and selector functions.

### **2. Distance Computation Between Locations**
- Implementing a function that calculates the **geographical distance** between two locations using latitude and longitude values.

### **3. Finding the Nearest Location**
- Writing a function to determine the **closest location** in a list based on a given reference point.

### **4. Nested List Manipulations**
- Extracting specific elements from deeply nested lists (e.g., retrieving all cherry values in a structured list).

### **5. Functional Computation Methods**
- Implementing the same logical condition check across a list using **different paradigms**:
  - Iteration (loops)
  - Recursion
  - List Comprehensions
  - Higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce)

### **6. Prime Number Computation (Sieve of Eratosthenes)**
- Implementing an efficient algorithm to compute prime numbers up to a given limit.

## **Installation and Execution**
### **Prerequisites**
- **Python 3.x** installed.
- Understanding of **functions, recursion, and data structures** in Python.

### **Running the Code**
To execute the solutions, open a terminal or command prompt and run:
```sh
python Assignment3-Solved.py
```

To test individual functions interactively:
```sh
python
>>> from Assignment3_Solved import function_name
>>> function_name(arguments)
```

---

## **Testing the Implementation**
The solutions contain **doctests** for automatic correctness verification. To run the tests:
```sh
python -m doctest -v Assignment3-Solved.py
```
This will output test results indicating whether the solutions match expected outputs.

## **Applications**
- **Geographical Information Systems (GIS):** Computing distances and managing location-based data.
- **Algorithm Optimization:** Implementing **efficient search algorithms**.
- **Functional Programming:** Applying different computation models to solve the same problem efficiently.
- **Data Science & AI:** Utilizing list processing and filtering techniques.
