# **Python Programming - Assignment 1**

## **Overview**
This assignment consists of several programming exercises in **Python**, designed to test your understanding of **functions, recursion, input handling, mathematical operations, and string manipulation**. The exercises follow structured programming principles and require implementing solutions using specific constraints.

---

## **Topics Covered**
### **1. Mathematical Expressions without Arithmetic Operators**
- Implementing functions that compute mathematical expressions using only **functional calls** (e.g., `add()`, `mul()`, `truediv()`) instead of arithmetic operators.

### **2. Recursive and Iterative Computations**
- Implementing **recursive functions** to manipulate numbers and compute mathematical values.

### **3. String Manipulation and Formatting**
- Functions that modify and format strings to achieve specific outputs.

### **4. User Input Processing**
- Handling user input for interactive functions that require direct input processing.

### **5. Functional Programming Concepts**
- Using functional constructs to avoid repetition and improve code efficiency.

To test individual functions interactively:
```sh
python
>>> from Assignment1_Solved import function_name
>>> function_name(arguments)
```

## **Exercise Breakdown**
### **Exercise 1: Mathematical Function Implementation**
- Compute the expression `1/(2 + 3/(x+4) + 1/x)` using only function calls, without `+` or `/` operators.

### **Exercise 2: Computing Expressions with Operators**
- Implement the function using **explicit arithmetic operators** instead of function calls.

### **Exercise 3: Variable Swapping and Computation**
- Swap values of variables in a sequence of operations to achieve the desired result.

### **Exercise 4: String Manipulation**
- Modify a function to return correct string concatenations.

### **Exercise 5: Iterative String Formatting**
- Implement a function that repeats a pattern based on input parameters.

### **Exercise 6: Recursive String Modification**
- Implement recursion-based concatenation of strings.

### **Exercise 7: Handling User Input**
- Implement input functions that take user input and compute the required results dynamically.

### **Exercise 8: Repeating User Input**
- Design an interactive function that mimics a parrot, repeating user input multiple times.

### **Exercise 9: Character Display Based on Input**
- Print a specific number of `+` or `-` characters based on the given number.

### **Exercise 10: Refactoring Redundant Computations**
- Refactor a function to avoid redundant calculations using function abstraction.

## **Testing the Implementation**
The solutions contain **doctests** for automatic correctness verification. To run the tests:
```sh
python -m doctest -v Assignment1-Solved.py
```
This will output test results indicating whether the solutions match expected outputs.

## **Applications**
- **Software Development:** Understanding function-based and structured programming principles.
- **Algorithm Design:** Writing efficient, reusable, and optimized code.
- **Data Science & AI:** Developing structured Python scripts for data processing.
