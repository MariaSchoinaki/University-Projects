# **Relations & Propositional Logic - Assignment**

## **Overview**
This assignment covers fundamental topics in **Discrete Mathematics**, focusing on **Relations and Propositional Logic**. The problems explore **equivalence relations, partial order relations, logical equivalences, and normal forms**.

---

## **Topics Covered**
### **1. Equivalence Relations**
- Examining whether a given relation is an **equivalence relation**.
- **Equivalence classes** of elements in ℤ (integers).

### **2. Logical Properties of Relations**
- Proving **symmetry, transitivity, and reflexivity** of different relations.
- Understanding conditions under which a relation is **self-reflexive**.

### **3. Modular Arithmetic & Equivalence Relations**
- Proving that a relation defined as **x² ≡ y² (mod 4)** is an equivalence relation.
- Finding the **equivalence classes** in ℤ for the given relation.

### **4. Composition of Relations**
- Constructing a new relation **R** based on properties of another relation **S**.
- Proving that **R is an equivalence relation** given that S is reflexive and transitive.

### **5. Partial Order Relations**
- Examining whether the **union of two partial orders** is also a partial order.

### **6. Propositional Logic & Relations**
- Analyzing a **relation defined on propositional formulas** to determine logical properties.
- Checking reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.

### **7. Logical Equivalence of Propositional Statements**
- Determining whether two given propositional expressions are **tautologically equivalent**.

### **8. Conjunctive & Disjunctive Normal Forms**
- Converting a given propositional formula into **Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)**.
