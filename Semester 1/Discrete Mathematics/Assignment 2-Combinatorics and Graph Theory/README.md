# **Combinatorics & Graph Theory - Assignment**

## **Overview**
This assignment covers fundamental problems in **Combinatorics and Graph Theory**, focusing on **permutations, combinatorial counting, set operations, and properties of graphs**. The problems involve **enumerative combinatorics, inclusion-exclusion principles, Eulerian graphs, and degree constraints in graphs**.

---

## **Topics Covered**
### **1. Permutations with Constraints**
- Finding the number of permutations of a set **A = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}** that contain specific subsequences (`ba` and `gf`).

### **2. Binary Strings & Combinatorial Counting**
- Counting the number of **0-1 words of length 12**:
  - (i) With an equal number of 0s and 1s.
  - (ii) With at least 3 ones.

### **3. Set Operations & Inclusion-Exclusion**
- Computing **|A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3|** given subset relations:
  - **A1 ⊆ A2 ⊆ A3** with known cardinalities.

### **4. Word Rearrangement & Permutations**
- Counting **distinct rearrangements** of the word **ΔΙΑΚΡΙΤΑ**.
- Finding permutations where **both 'A' letters appear adjacent**.

### **5. Graph Degree Distribution**
- Given a graph **G with 12 edges and 6 vertices**, where each vertex has degree **2 or 5**, determining how many vertices have degree **2** and how many have degree **5**.

### **6. Eulerian Graph Theorem**
- Proving that a **k-regular connected graph** with an **even number of vertices but an odd number of edges** is **not Eulerian**.

### **7. Triangle-Free Graph Degree Sum**
- Proving that if a **simple graph G with n vertices** contains no **triangles (3-cycles)**, then for any two adjacent vertices **u, v**:
  
  \[ d_G(u) + d_G(v) ≤ n \]

### **8. Planar Graph Face Calculation**
- Given a **5-regular connected planar graph** with **48 vertices**, computing the number of **faces (regions)**.
