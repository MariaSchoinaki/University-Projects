# **Probabilities**

## **Overview**
This project consists of a collection of **exercise groups in probability theory** designed for students of the **Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB), Department of Informatics**. The exercises cover fundamental and advanced topics in **probability theory**, including combinatorial probability, conditional probability, random variables, distributions, and statistical inference.

---

### **Key Topics Covered**
- **Basic Probability Principles** (Sample spaces, probability rules, conditional probability)
- **Combinatorial Probability** (Counting methods, permutations, and combinations)
- **Random Variables & Distributions** (Discrete and continuous distributions, expected values, variance)
- **Independence & Conditional Probability**
- **Probability Inequalities & Theorems** (Bayesâ€™ Theorem, Bonferroni inequalities)
- **Stochastic Processes & Applications**
