# 2D-Tree
This is a Java implementation of a 2D tree, a data structure used for efficiently storing and querying points in two-dimensional space. A 2D tree is a binary tree in which each node represents a point in the plane and each level of the tree corresponds to a different dimension.

## Features
- Implementation of Point and Rectangle
- User friendly-menu with every possible selection
- Efficient tracking of the geometrical space
- Efficient implementation of a 2d-tree

## Data Structure Implemented
- 2d-tree
- List

## How to run the project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Import the project into any Java IDE
3. Run the TwoDTree class
4. Type the inpunts you want
